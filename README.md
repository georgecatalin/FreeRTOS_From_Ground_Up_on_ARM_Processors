### Description
![Course Synapsis](2023-07-25_15-13-39.png)

> This course teaches you the foundations of real-time systems and how to build real-time applications using FreeRTOS ,one of the most popular real-time operating systems  for embedded systems.
> 
>  By the end of this course you should be able to build your own multitask FreeRTOS  real-time applications which use all the features of a modern real-time application (such as semaphores, mutexes, event flags, hooks, queues, mailboxes etc )and  test their performance.
